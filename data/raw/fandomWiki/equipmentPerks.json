The first stack is received after killing one mob, then 2nd stack after killing 3 more mobs, and then the 3rd stack after 5 more mobs. Each stack has it's own timer and it's usually 30 seconds. So you'll lose one stack 30 seconds after getting the first stack. To get 3 stacks, you should kill 9 mobs within 30 seconds (until the first stack is lost), and 3 stacks won't last for too long anyway It's pretty easy to keep 2 stacks active if killing monsters non-stop. It's currently unknown if the 4th stack exists - it may exist after killing 7 mobs while having 3 stacks(assuming each stack requires 2 more mobs than the previous stack), and it should be done within 30 seconds after getting the first stack - so 16 mobs in 30 seconds timeframe.\n"
