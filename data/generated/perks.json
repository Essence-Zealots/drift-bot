  "introText": "Weapons and armor can have special perks on them. \"Uncommon\" or better equipment have some perks by default (the amount depends on the rarity of the item), and more perks can be added by enchanting the item (perks are added at +4, +8, and +10). Perks can be Tier 1, 2 or 3 depending on item quality (regular/superior/flawless) on generation, with higher tiers being better (perks added by enchanting are always Tier 1 regardless of item quality). Common equipment can have perks added by enhancing them to +4 (cannot be enhanced beyond +5).",
  "buffsAndStacksText": "It looks like that all buffs received upon killing an enemy do stack. The first stack is received after killing one mob, then 2nd stack after killing 3 more mobs, and then the 3rd stack after 5 more mobs. Each stack has it's own timer and it's usually 30 seconds. So you'll lose one stack 30 seconds after getting the first stack. To get 3 stacks, you should kill 9 mobs within 30 seconds (until the first stack is lost), and 3 stacks won't last for too long anyway It's pretty easy to keep 2 stacks active if killing monsters non-stop. It's currently unknown if the 4th stack exists - it may exist after killing 7 mobs while having 3 stacks(assuming each stack requires 2 more mobs than the previous stack), and it should be done within 30 seconds after getting the first stack - so 16 mobs in 30 seconds timeframe.\n",
