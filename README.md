## Commands

* `/recipe`: search for recipes by name and rarity

* `/config`: configure custom settings for each discord channel

## Features 


### üë• Party Listing

When using `/party create` command, the bot will guide you through creating a new party list and it'll post it on the cannel defined by the `/config` command (`party-listing` by default).  
It'll also listen to reactions so members can join or leave groups.  
To make use of this feature, make sure that the bot has enough permissions to the configured channel.  

**Examples**:
```bash
.party create
.party update
```


### üõ° Equipment search

An equipment search is available with `/equip <name>` command.  
It's also possible to filter them by rarity.
If a recipe is associated, it can be displayed by reacting with üõ†Ô∏è  

**Examples**:
```bash
/equip name: galian
/equip name: hardened rarity: unique
```

### üìú Recipe search

Similar to the commands above, you can search for recipes by name and rarity.  
Recipes with same results are shown together.  

**Examples**:
```bash
.recipe brakmar sword
.recipe espada de brakmar lang=pt
.recipe peace pipe rarity=mythical
```

### ‚öôÔ∏è Configurable options

Some bot options can be configurable according to each server using `/config`/.  
**Options**:
* partyChannel: channel to receive the `/party` command (default: `party-listing`)

**Examples**:
```bash
/config get
/config set party-channel: #party-listing
```
